# Routing and Data

Welcome to part 2 of Angular Getting Started. 

At the end of [part 1](getting-started), the online store application had a basic product catalog: 

* The app displays a top bar and a product list
* Users can click on a product name from the list to see details below
* Users can click on the `Share` button to share a product from the list or details

In this part, you'll extend the app to be more scalable. You'll:
* Change how product details are displayed so they are on their own page, using routing
* Change how product data is managed, to use services, the HttpClient, and an external data source (`json` file)
* Add a checkout page

<!--
## Introduction

Data your app needs can come from many different sources. Whether it be a static file, a backend API that exposes data through a JSON-based API, or other different formats, your app consumes and makes use of this data to make decisions and display content. Your app also needs data to be entered from users to fill out forms for processing. Angular provides libraries to help you consume and receive data by building on top of existing browser APIs. 
-->

## Routing and navigation

At the end of part 1, the user displays product details by clicking a product name. The details are displayed in the same page, below the list. This is done by using a simple click event on the product name. Notice that the preview pane URL does not change. 

In this section, we'll modify the app to display the product details in a separate page.

To do this, you'll use the Angular router.

<!--
JAF: Do we show them that the app is configured to use the router? Part 1 actually used the router to display the product list. Did it need to?
-->

1. Open the `product-list.component.html` file. 

1. On the anchor that displays the product name, replace the click event binding (`(click)="selectProduct(product)"`) with a `routerLink` to the product list template (`/products`).

  ```
  <h3>
    <a [title]="product.name"  [routerLink]="['/products', product.id]>
      <!-- interpolation -->
      {{ product.name }}
    </a>
  </h3>
  ```

1. Remove the Share buttons from the product list. 

<!--
JAF: Why? Extra step seems unnecessary
-->

1. Remove the product details component from below the product list. 

    <code-example header="src/app/product-list/product-list.component.html" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-list/product-list.component.html">
    </code-example>

1. Update the product details component template (`product-list.component.html`), so that the title "Product Details" is always displayed, but the product details information are only displayed if they exist. To do this, wrap the product details with an `*ngIf`. 

    <code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.html" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.1.html">
    </code-example>



    Now, when the user clicks on a name in the product list, the product list is replaced by the product details. 

1. Add a route in the `AppModule` for product details, with a `path` of `products/:productId` and `ProductDetailsComponent` for the `component`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/app.module.ts" region="product-details-route">
</code-example>

Click on each product to display the product details. Notice that the URL in the preview window changes. The final digit (1 or 2) is the product's `id` property. 

No product detail information is shown yet.

### Using Services, HttpClient, and router to fetch product details

Add HttpClientModule

1. Import `HttpClientModule` from `@angular/common/http` package.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/app.module.ts" region="http-client-module-import">
</code-example>

1. Add `HttpClientModule` to the `imports` array of the `AppModule`.

This registers Angular's Http Client providers globally.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/app.module.ts" region="http-client-module">
</code-example>

1. Here is a `DataService` defined with some cart functionality that you'll use later. You can define your own services to use also.

<code-example header="src/app/data.service.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/data.service.ts" region="v1">
</code-example>

1. There is some product data in `assets/products.json` already defined. This is to show fetching data from an external source.

<code-example header="src/assets/products.json" path="getting-started-v2/src/assets/products.json">
</code-example>

Import

1. Import `HttpClient` from `@angular/common/http` package.
1. Import `map` operator from `rxjs/operators` package.

<code-example header="src/app/data.service.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/data.service.ts" region="imports">
</code-example>

Inject `HttpClient`

1. Inject `HttpClient` into constructor of `DataService`

<code-example header="src/app/data.service.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/data.service.ts" region="ctor">
</code-example>

Retrieve the product details

1. Add `getOne()` method with a `productId` argument to the `DataService`. 
1. Use the `HttpClient#get()` method to retrieve the products from the JSON file
1. Use the `map` operator to find one product in the array of the products and return it

<code-example header="src/app/data.service.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/data.service.ts" region="get-one">
</code-example>

Update Details Component

Import

1. Import the `ActivatedRoute` service from the `@angular/router` package.
1. Import the `switchMap` operator from the `rxjs/operators` package.
1. Import the `DataService` to use its `getOne()` method to fetch product details.

<code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" region="imports">
</code-example>

Product Property and Inject Services

1. Remove the `Input` decorator from the `product` property in the product details component.
1. Remove the `share` property from the component.
1. Inject the `ActivatedRoute`, and `DataService` services to access route information and data access methods.

<code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" region="props-methods">
</code-example>

Retrive product details

1. In the `ngOnInit()` method, set the `product` property to the current route that uses the `paramMap` property on the route to access the `productId` parsed from the URL.
1. Use the `switchMap` operator on the route information stream to map it into a request for product details using the `DataService#getOne()` method
with the `productId`.
1. Subscribe to the details stream and and update the `product` property with the retrieved product details information.

<code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" region="get-product">
</code-example>

Add to cart

1. Define a `addToCart()` method that receives a `product` and use the previously defined `DataService#addToCart()` method to add the product your cart. Also add an `alert` that the product has been added to the cart.

<code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" region="add-to-cart">
</code-example>

Update template

1. Remove the `share` button in the template.
1. Add a `button` that says `Buy` to the template with a `click` event binding to call the `addToCart()` method with the `product`.

<code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.html" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.html">
</code-example>

## Success Point


## Requesting data with the Angular Http Client

Data coming back from servers in Angular applications most frequently take the form of a stream. Streams are useful because they make it easy to transform the data that is coming back, and to make modifications to the way data is requested. The Angular Http Client is a built-in way to fetch data from external APIs and provide them to your application as a stream. 

Similarly with the Angular Router, the `HttpClientModule` registers the providers needed to use a single instance of the `HttpClient` service throughout your application. The `HttpClient` service is what you inject into your services to fetch data and interact with external APIs and resources. The `HttpClient` also uses observables to handle requests and provide responses. 

In this section you'll:

* Learn how to register Angular's Http Client
* Fetch data from an external source
* Use the Angular Router to fetch route information and use that information to request data.

### Pulling data using `HttpClient`

Currently, your products data is using the `data` property in the `ProductService` for its data. For a real world application, this data would be fetched from an external API or resource such as a JSON file. To show how to use `HttpClient`, you'll update the `ProductService` to pull the data from a JSON file using the `HttpClient` service.

#### 1. Import HttpClientModule

In the `app.module.ts` file, import `HttpClientModule` from the `@angular/common/http` package.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (HttpClientModule)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.2.ts" region="http-client-module">
</code-example>

#### 2. Register `HttpClientModule`

Add the `HttpClientModule` to the `imports` array of the `AppModule`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (HttpClientModule imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.2.ts" region="http-client-module-imports">
</code-example>

#### 3. Create external JSON data file

Currently, the data for the product list is hard-coded into the `ProductService`, which is not something you want to do often. Instead, you request the data from an external file or resource that is more dynamic. Below, you'll create an external file for the `HttpClient` to retrieve the product list data. 

1. Right click on the `src` folder and create an `assets` folder.  the src folder to contain the products JSON file.
2. Create a `products.json` file in the `assets` folder to contain the object data is currently hard-coded in the `ProductService`.
3. Copy the contents from the `data` property in the `ProductService` to the `products.json` file.

<code-example header="src/assets/products.json (Products JSON)" path="getting-started/src/assets/products.json">
</code-example>

#### 4. Import HttpClient

Import the HttpClient class from the `@angular/common/http` package into the `product.service.ts` file

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (HttpClient import)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.ts" linenums="false" region="httpclient">
</code-example>

#### 5. Import RxJS operators

Import the map operator from the RxJS library using the `rxjs/operators` package.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (RxJS map operator)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.ts" linenums="false" region="rxjs-import">
</code-example>

#### 6. Inject HttpClient

Inject the `HttpClient` service into the `ProductService` by adding it to the constructor as a private variable.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (HttpClient)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.ts" linenums="false" region="httpclient-inject">
</code-example>

#### 7. Request and return data from JSON file

Update the `getAll()` method to transform the results of the `HttpClient#get()` method using the `map()` operator to return the products.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (Http.get)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.ts" linenums="false" region="httpclient-get-all">
</code-example>

- The `HttpClient#get()` method returns an observable of the external request made to fetch the `products`. This observable will not execute until the method is subscribed to. 
- The `products.json` is an object with a `products` property. The `{ products: Product[] }` provides type information about the observable stream being returned from the request. 
- The `map()` operator is a function that is called with the results from the request, which then transforms the data into a new observable array of the products.

Remove the `Observable` and `of` imports from the rxjs package, and the data property in the `ProductService`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.ts" linenums="false" region="complete">
</code-example>

When you reload the page, the product list still displays the same information, but the data can be changed dynamically without changing your code. 

### Retrieving details for a product

You've retrieved a list of the products with their associated information. You'll use that list to show the details of an individual product. In a real world application, retrieving an individual product might have a separate endpoint, but for this guide, you'll reuse the product list for an individual product.

#### Add properties to product

Update the `Product` interface in the `product.ts` file with more properties about a given product, 
such as its price, and categories.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.ts (Product interface)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.ts" linenums="false">
</code-example>

You can safely reference these properties as part of a `Product` in your app now.

In the `ProductService`, add a `getOne()` method that takes an `id` and returns an observable of one `product` based on the `productId`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (getOne())" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.ts" linenums="false" region="httpclient-get-one">
</code-example>

The `map()` operator takes the existing array of products, and uses the `Array#filter()` method to find the product based on the `productId`. As mentioned earlier, you are transforming a stream of an array of products into a new stream of a single product.

### Displaying details for a product

The `ProductService` handles retrieving of all products and a a single product. You'll use the `ProductService` and the Angular Router to combine and transform streams of data to display the product details.

#### Import RxJS types and operators

In the `product-details.component.ts`:

1. Import the `Observable` type from the `rxjs` package.
2. Import the `switchMap` operator from the `rxjs/operators` package.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts (RxJS imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.2.ts" linenums="false" region="rxjs-imports">
</code-example>

#### Import current route information

To see information provided by the router for a routed component, each routed component is provided an `ActivatedRoute` service. You inject the `ActivatedRoute` service to access its route parameters, route data, and other necessary information. 

Import the `ActivatedRoute` from the `@angular/router` package

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts (Router imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.2.ts" linenums="false" region="activated-route-import">
</code-example>

#### Import product types

Import the `ProductService` class and `Product` interface.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts (Product imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.2.ts" linenums="false" region="product-imports">
</code-example>

#### Define product property

To reference the `product` in the component template, you need to define it as a property of the component class.

Create a `product` property in the `ProductDetailsComponent` class with the type of `Observable<Product>`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.2.ts" linenums="false" region="product">
</code-example>

#### Retreive the individual product

To retreive an individual product, you must transform the stream containing the `productId` into a request for the product information. The Angular Router contains the route information, and the `ProductService` requests the product. Map these two streams together to retrieve the product.

1. Inject the `ProductService` and `ActivatedRoute` classes in the constructor of the `ProductDetailsComponent`.
2. Define the `product` property to retrieve the route’s params as an observable and `switchMap` it into a request made by the `ProductService.getOne()` method using the `productId`.

The route parameters are provided as an observable you subscribe to. When the parameters observable is updated, the observable produce a new value.

<div class="alert is-important">

**Note:** The process of transitioning from one observable stream into another with an operator ending with `Map` is called "flattening". The route parameters stream is flattened and mapped into the second stream of retrieving the individual product. Read more about observable streams in the [Observables](guide/observables) guide.

</div>

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts (Product stream)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.2.ts" linenums="false" region="product-details">
</code-example>

#### Display the product details in the template

The `product` property is defined as a stream for an individual `Product`. To display it in the component's template, you need to subscribe to the stream of data to consume its value. Angular provides an `AsyncPipe` to subscribe to an observable stream directly in the template.

Update the `ProductDetailsComponent` template to subscribe to `product`.

1. Use the `AsyncPipe` and assign it to a template variable `productInfo`.
2. Display the product name, price, description and a button to buy the item.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.html (Product details template)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.1.html" linenums="false">
</code-example>

In the example above, you assigned the `product` as an `productInfo` in the template. This allows you to reuse the same reference in multiple places, instead of using the `AsyncPipe` multiple times, which creates multiple subscriptions.

## Managing additional data with a service

You've used the `ProductService` to retrieve a list of products, and to retrieve an individual product. To finish out the buying process, you'll need to store the products the user intends to buy. This data is managed separately from the products themselves, so you'll need a separate service to store information about items in the cart.

### Storing products for the cart

The product details includes `Buy` button for each product that you need to capture for the checkout process. You'll store the cart items using a service that is accessible from the page where the user checks out.

Right click on the `app` folder, use the `Angular Generator`, and generate a service named `cart`.

<code-example header="src/app/cart.service.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/cart.service.1.ts">
</code-example>

Update the `CartService` file with functionality to add products, and return a list of the products purchased. There are many ways to implement this service, but for this guide you'll only focus on two methods.

<code-example header="src/app/cart.service.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/cart.service.ts">
</code-example>

* The `ProductService` is injected into the `CartService` as a dependency to retrieve all products.
* The `items` property stores a list of the current products in the cart.
* The `add()` method appends a product to an array of `items` defined in the `CartService`. 
* The `getAll()` method collects the items added to the cart and returns each item with its associated quantity.

### Adding products to the cart

The `CartService` adds the product each time the `CartService#add` method is called. Because services are shared, the `ProductDetailsComponent` can use the service to add products to the cart. Update the `ProductDetailsComponent` to add the `product` to the cart when the `Buy` button is clicked. 

#### Import CartService

In the `product-details.component.ts` file:

Import the `CartService`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts" region="cart-imports">
</code-example>

#### Inject CartService

Inject the `CartService` as a dependency to the constructor of the `ProductDetailsComponent`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts" region="cart-service">
</code-example>

#### Add product to cart

Add an `onBuy()` method to the `ProductDetailsComponent` class that calls the `CartService#add()` method with the `product`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.ts" region="buy">
</code-example>

Add a click event listener to the Buy button that calls the `onBuy()` method you defined in the component class.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-details/product-details.component.html" region="buy">
</code-example>

Now you refresh the application, click on product details, click the Buy button, and the product is added to the stored list of items in the cart.

## Collecting data with Angular Reactive Forms

Forms in Angular take the standard capabilities of the HTML based forms and add an orchestration layer to help with creating custom form controls, and to supply great validation experiences. There are two parts to an Angular Reactive form, the objects that live in the component to store and manage the form, and the visualization of the form that lives in the template.

In this section you'll:

* Learn how to register Angular's Reactive Forms.
* Build a form model to store the form data and reflect it in the component template.
* Use an `*ngIf` directive to conditionally add and remove elements.

### Creating a checkout page and form

The products are stored each time the `Buy` button is clicked, but the checkout page is where the checkout process is completed. You'll build out the checkout page to list the cart items and submit the purchase.

#### Import ReactiveFormsModule

1. Import `ReactiveFormsModule` from the `@angular/forms` package.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (ReactiveFormsModule imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.2.ts" region="reactive-forms-module">
</code-example>

#### Register ReactiveFormsModule

2. Add `ReactiveFormsModule` to the `imports` array of the `AppModule`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (ReactiveFormsModule imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.2.ts" region="reactive-forms-module-imports">
</code-example>

The `ReactiveFormsModule` provides the services and directives to build reactive forms in Angular. Read more about Angular forms in the [Forms Overview](guide/forms-overview).

#### Create checkout component

The form lives in a component's TypeScript class and its template. In the component you'll add the objects needed to store the checkout form in the constructor of the component. You'll also create a method to handle user submission of a valid form.

Right click on the `app` folder, use the `Angular Generator`, and generate a component named `checkout`.

#### Import reactive forms classes
 
To build out the form model, you'll need to import some building blocks from the forms package.

Import `FormGroup`, `FormBuilder` from `@angular/forms` package.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (Reactive forms imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="forms-imports">
</code-example>

#### Import CartService

Import the `CartService` class, and the `CartItem` interface for type information.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="cart-imports">
</code-example>

#### Create items property

To store the cart items locally in the component class, you need to create a class property.

Create an `items` property with type `CartItem[]`. You'll reference the items in the class and in the component template.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (Checkout form)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="cart-items">
</code-example>

#### Create form property

In a reactive form, the form model, which is the source of truth for the form value and validation status, is defined in the component class. 

Create a `checkoutForm` property with type `FormGroup`. You'll create the `FormGroup` in the constructor using the `FormBuilder`.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (Checkout form)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="checkout-form">
</code-example>

The `checkoutForm` property will store the form model for handling input from the user.

#### Inject Services

Inject the `FormBuilder` and `CartService` as dependencies in the constructor of the `CheckoutComponent`.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="cart-service">
</code-example>

The `FormBuilder` is a service provided for easily construction form controls in your component class. The `CartService` you defined earlier is for adding items to the cart.

#### Create form model

The source of truth for the form model for reactive forms is defined in the component class. The form model is reflected in the template through directives provided by Angular reactive forms.

Use the `FormBuilder#group()` method to create a form group with name and address.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (Form Builder)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="formbuilder">
</code-example>

The `checkoutForm` is defined to handle the name and address input fields from the user. You could also validate that the name and address fields are required using built-in validators for length and other requirements.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

Learn more about validation in the [form validation guide](guide/form-validation).

</div>

#### Displaying the form model in the template

The form model is defined in the `CheckoutComponent` class. The template needs to be updated to reflect the form model.

1. Use an `NgFor` directive to iterate over the `items`, display each product name and total for the quantity purchased.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.html (cart items)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.1.html" linenums="false" region="list">
</code-example>

1. Define a `form` tag in the template and bind the `checkoutForm` from the component class to the `formGroup` attribute on the form. 
2. Set an event listener for the `ngSubmit` event and call the `onSubmit()` method with the checkoutForm value.
3. Add input fields for name and address using `formControlName` directive.
4. Add a `submit` button to trigger the form submission.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.html (checkout form)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.1.html" linenums="false" region="form">
</code-example>

Define an `onSubmit()` method to log the customer data when the form is submitted. To go further, you would submit the data to an external API using the `CartService`, but for now you'll log to the browser console.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (on submit)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="on-submit">
</code-example>

#### Populate list of cart items

The `ngOnInit()` method in  `CheckoutComponent` class is a lifecycle hook. The `ngOnInit()` method is called after the component is initialized. This initialization is after the constructor, but provides you a place to perform additional logic for your component. Read more about this and other hooks in the [lifecycle hooks](guide/lifecycle-hooks) guide.

In the `ngOnInit()` method, subscribe to the `CartService#getAll()` method to listen to a stream its values. When the stream outputs a value, you want to store the items on the `items` property in the component class.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (ngOnInit())" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="on-init">
</code-example>

The checkout page will display the items that have been added to the card above the checkout form.

#### Completing the checkout process

To end the checkout process, you'll want to hide the checkout form upon clicking the `Purchase` button. Because you can use the `NgIf` discussed earlier to add and remove elements from the page dynamically, you'll use this flag to trigger the display and removal of an element in the component template.

1. Add a `submitted` property to the `CheckoutComponent` class that defaults to `false`. 

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (submitted property)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="submitted">
</code-example>

2. Add a message to the `CheckoutComponent` template with an attached `NgIf` directive that is based on the `submitted` property. 

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.html (submitted message)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.html" region="submitted">
</code-example>

3. Set the `submitted` property to `true` in the `onSubmit()` method.

<code-example header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts (set submitted)" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" region="set-submitted">
</code-example>

Now when you complete the user form and click the `Purchase` button, the form is removed from the page and the message is displayed.

### Adding the checkout route

To access the checkout route from your application, it needs to be registered with the Angular Router.

Add a route in the array of routes for the `CheckoutComponent`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (checkout route)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.ts" linenums="false" region="checkout-route">
</code-example>

The checkout page route is registered, so you can type the URL in manually. To access the checkout route easily, add a `routerLink` to the `TopBarComponent` template.

<code-example header="src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html (checkout link)" path="getting-started/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html" linenums="false" region="checkout-link">
</code-example>

After the user adds items to the cart, fills out the form, and submits the button, the customer data is logged to the browser console. 
Your shopping cart is now accessing data from the internet and allowing users to checkout.

In this section:

<code-tabs>

  <code-pane header="src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html">
  </code-pane>  

  <code-pane header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.ts">
  </code-pane>

  <code-pane header="src/app/checkout/checkout.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/checkout/checkout.component.html">
  </code-pane>

  <code-pane header="src/app/app.module.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.ts">
  </code-pane>  

</code-tabs>
