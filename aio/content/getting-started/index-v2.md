{@a components}
## Components

Let's take a quick look at the structure of our app.

*Components* are the building blocks of Angular apps. 
A component is comprised of three things: 
* A class that handles data and functionality 
* An HTML template, which determines what is presented to the user 
* Styles that define the look and feel 

An Angular application is composed of a tree of components, in which each Angular component has a specific purpose and responsibility. 

Our starter app has three components: 

<figure>
  <img src='generated/images/guide/getting-started/starter-app-components.png' alt="Online store with three components">
</figure>

* app-root: The application shell. This is first component to load, and the parent of all other components. You can think of it as the base page. 
* app-top-bar: The top bar for our online store, with the store name and checkout button.
* app-product-list: The product list for our online store.. 

Right now, the app displays the title "Products", but it does not display the list of products. In the next section, you'll modify the component's HTML template to display the list of products defined in the component class.


{@a template-syntax}
## Template syntax

Angular extends HTML with a template syntax that gives components control over the display of content. 
This section introduces five things you can do in an Angular template to affect what your user sees, based on the component's state and behavior: 

* `*ngFor`
* `*ngIf`
* Interpolation {{ }}
* Property binding [ ]
* Event binding ( ) 

We'll use these to add the product list to the "Products" area of the app. 


1. Open the `product-list` folder. It contains one file for each part of the component: 
    * `product-list-component.ts` contains the component class definition
    * `product-list-component.html` is the HTML template 
    * `product-list-component.css` contains component-specific styles


1. Open the `product-list-component.ts` file. The `ProductListComponent` class defines properties for two products: 

    ```
    export class ProductListComponent {
      products = [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Phone XL',
          price: 799,
          description: 'A large phone with one of the best screens'
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          name: "Phone Mini",
          price: 699,
          description: 'A great phone with one of the best cameras'
        }
    ```

    We want to display the name and description of these products in our "Products" list. 

1. Open the component's template file `product-list-component.html`. This is the file we'll modify to display the product list.

    <code-example header="src/app/product-list/product-list.component.html" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-list/product-list.component.1.html">
    </code-example>

2. We want the `<div>` element to appear once for each product in the list. To do that, use the `*ngFor` directive inside the `<div>`, as shown below:  

    ```
    <h2>Products</h2>

    <!-- ngfor -->
    <div *ngFor="let product of products">
    ```

    <div class="alert is-helpful">
    `*ngFor` is a "structural directive". Structural directives change which HTML or components are displayed.  Technically, they shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached. Any directive with an * is a structural directive.
    </div>


3. Inside the anchor, display the product's name by using the interpolation syntax {{ }}. Interpolation renders a property's value as text.  

    ```
    <h2>Products</h2>

      <!-- ngFor -->
      <div *ngFor="let product of products">

      <h3>
        <a>
          <!-- interpolation -->
          {{ product.name }}
        </a>
      </h3>
    ```

    The app now displays the name of each product in the list. 

    <figure>
      <img src='generated/images/guide/getting-started/template-syntax-product-names.png' alt="Product names added to list">
    </figure>

    <!--
    The product name anchors are inactive. Later we'll link the displayed names to product details.
    --> 

    <div class="alert is-helpful">
    Reminder: You might need to save the project and reload the preview pane to see the changes. 
    </div>

4. To create hover text for each anchor, we'll use property binding. Bind the anchor's title attribute to the component's product name property by using the property binding syntax [ ]. 

    <code-example header="src/app/product-list/product-list.component.html" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-list/product-list.component.2.html">
    </code-example>

    <!-- 
    JAF: Can we display something different from the name?
    -->

5. Add the product descriptions. On the paragraph tag, use an `*ngIf` directive to show the element if it has a description.

    <code-example header="src/app/product-list/product-list.component.html" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-list/product-list.component.3.html">
    </code-example>

    <!-- 
    JAF: This might be more compelling if we had a product without a description. Then we can go add a description later. One idea: add a product property for "in stock" and only display products that are in stock. 
    -->

    The app now displays the name and description of each product in the list, as shown here: 

    <figure>
      <img src='generated/images/guide/getting-started/template-syntax-product-description.png' alt="Product descriptions added to list">
    </figure>

6. Add a button so users can share a product with friends. The `ProductListComponent` class (in the `product-list.component.ts` file) already defines a `share()` method, which we can bind to the `click` event. Event binding is done by using ( ) around the event. 

    1. Add a button element to the HTML.
    1. Add an event binding for a `click` event to call the `share()` method in the component. 

        <code-example header="src/app/product-list/product-list.component.html" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-list/product-list.component.4.html">
        </code-example>

        <figure>
          <img src='generated/images/guide/getting-started/template-syntax-product-share-button.png' alt="Share button added for each product name">
        </figure>



<div class="alert is-helpful">

</div>

<!-- 
JAF: I want a break here
-->

## Input

At this point, our app is just a product catalog, displaying a list of products, with names and descriptions. 

You might have noticed that the `ProductListComponent` class also defined a price property for each product. We're going to use the anchor on each product name to display additional product details, which will include the price. We'll create that product details view as a new component. We'll pass the selected product in to the product details component. 

<!-- 
JAF: I thought we were using price in the summary and adding description in the details.
-->

1. Generate a new component for product details. 

    Stackblitz includes an Angular Generator, which makes it easy to create new Angular components. 

    1. In the file list, right-click the `app` folder, choose `Angular Generator` and `Component`.

        <figure>
          <img src='generated/images/guide/getting-started/generate-component.png' alt="Generate component">
        </figure>

    1. In the input field, give the new component the name `product-details`.

    Stackblitz creates a skeleton component class, HTML template, and component style sheet. 

1. Open the `product-details.component.ts` component class file. 

    Notice the `@Component` annotation:
    
    ```
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-product-details',
      templateUrl: './product-details.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./product-details.component.css']
    })
    ```
    
    The *selector* `app-product-details` is the name you use to refer to the Angular component when it is rendered as an HTML element on the page. By convention, Angular component selectors begin with the prefix such as `app-`, followed by the component name. 

    You'll use this name to include the product details element at the bottom of the product list. 

1. Display the product details below the product list. 

    1. Open the `product-list.component.html` template file. 
    1. Below the closing `<div>`, add the product details component as shown here: 
        ```
            <button (click)="share()">
                Share
            </button>
        </div>
        <app-product-details></app-product-details>
        ```
        In the app preview pane, the words "product-details works!" appear the product list. That text is coming from the product details component's template. 

1. Update the product details template (`product-details.component.html`) to display the product name, price, and description instead of "product-details works!":
    ```
    <h2>Product Details</h2>
      <h3>{{ product.name }}</h3>
      <h4>{{ product.price | currency }}</h4>
      <p>{{ product.description }}</p>
    ```
  
    The "Product Details" heading appears instead of "product-details works!". The product properties don't yet appear because the product is unassigned. We need to pass the selected product from the product list into the product details. 

1. Set up the product details component to receive input: 

    1. Return to the `product-details.component.ts` component class file.
    
    1. Import `Input` from the `@angular/core` package.

        <code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.1.ts" region="imports">
        </code-example>

        <!--
        JAF: Stackblitz doesn't match. Might be less confusing to add the new 3 as a new import statement. 
        -->

        <!--
        JAF: Do we need to explain importing here? 
        -->

    1. In the `ProductDetailsComponent` class, define a property named `product` with an `Input` decorator.

        <code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.1.ts" region="input-output">
        </code-example>
    
        The @Input decorator specifies that the product data can be passed into your component. 

1. Set up the product list component to manage the selected product: 

    1. Open the `product-list.component.ts` component class file.
    1. In the `ProductListComponent` class, add a `selectedProduct` property.
    1. In the `ProductListComponent` class, add a method named `selectProduct()`. This method sets the `selectedProduct` property with the provided product. 

        <code-example header="src/app/product-list/product-list.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-list/product-list.component.ts" region="product">
        </code-example>

1. Set up the product list template so that users can select a product name to display the details. 

    1. Open the `product-list.component.html` template file.
    1. To let app users select a product by clicking on a name, add an event binding to the product name anchor element to call `selectProduct(product)`.
        ```
        <h3>
        <!-- property binding -->
           <a [title]="product.name" (click)="selectProduct(product)">
           <!-- interpolation -->
           {{ product.name }}
           </a>
        </h3>
        ```
    1. To display the details for the selected product, update the `<app-product-details>` element to use an `*ngIf` on the product details component for a product
        ```
        <app-product-details
            *ngIf="selectedProduct"
       </app-product-details>
        ```

        If there is no selected product, the "Product Details" section does not display. Reload the preview pane to reset the app to not having a selected product. 

    1. Pass the selected product to the product details component using a property binding:
        ```
        <app-product-details
            *ngIf="selectedProduct"
            [product]="selectedProduct"
       </app-product-details>
        ```

        <figure>
          <img src='generated/images/guide/getting-started/product-details.png' alt="Display details for selected product">
        </figure>

## Output

It would be nice if a user could share a product from the details. This gives us the opportunity to look at how Angular components handle output using events. 

1. Set up the product details component to emit events: 

    1. Open the `product-details.component.ts` component class file.

    1. Import `Output` and `EventEmitter` from the `@angular/core` package.

        <code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.1.ts" region="imports">
        </code-example>

    1. In the `ProductDetailsComponent` class, define an output property named `share` with an `@Output` decorator and an instance of `EventEmitter`:

        <code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.1.ts" region="input-output">
        </code-example>

1. In the product details template (`product-details.component.html`), add a Share button similar to the ones in the product list. In this case, set up an event binding to call the `share.emit()` method:

    <code-example header="src/app/product-details/product-details.component.ts" path="getting-started-v2/src/app/product-details/product-details.component.1.html" region="input-output">
    </code-example>

1. In the product list template (`product-details.component.html`), add an event listener for the “share” event:

  <!--
  JAF: from the component that calls the same `share()` method
  -->

  ```
  <app-product-details
      *ngIf="selectedProduct"
      [product]="selectedProduct"
      (share)="share()">
  </app-product-details>
  ```

  <!--
  JAF: Can we find a better use of output. Seems to duplicate a feature that we already have at the list level. Hmm
  -->

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've completed your first Angular app!

You have an online store application with a product catalog: 

* The app displays a top bar and a product list
* Users can click on a product name from the list to see details below
* Users can click on the `Share` button to share a product from the list or details

To continue exploring Angular, we recommend any of the following options:
* Do the add-on Getting Started lessons in order: Managing Data, Forms, Deployment. The add-on modules extend the online store app to be more robust and scalable, introducing more Angular foundation skills. 
* Skip ahead to the [Deployment](getting-started/getting-started-deployment) add-on lesson to deploy your app to Firebase or move to local development. 
* Read more about the Angular app [architecture](guide/architecture).
